How It Works

Loading Products:

Displaying Products:
. The ProductList component displays each product along with an "Add to Cart" button

Managing Cart State:
. When a user clicks the "Add to Cart" button, the application checks if the product is already in the cart:
. If it is not, the product is added to the cart.
. If it is, an alert shows a message indicating that the item is already in the cart.

Viewing the Cart:
. Users can open the cart modal by clicking the "Cart" button. 
. This modal shows all products added to the cart and their details.

Removing Items:
. Each product in the cart modal includes a "Remove from Cart" button. 
. Clicking this button removes the product from the cart and updates the state accordingly.

User Feedback:
The application provides immediate feedback to users regarding their actions, such as adding or removing items from the cart.
